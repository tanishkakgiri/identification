    <p>Google Lens is an image recognition technology developed by Google, designed to bring up relevant information related to objects it identifies using visual analysis based on a neural network.[2] First announced during Google I/O 2017,[3] it was first provided as a standalone app, later being integrated into Android's standard camera app.Google officially launched Google Lens on October 4, 2017 with app previews pre-installed into the Google Pixel 2.[9] In November 2017, the feature began rolling out into the Google Assistant for Pixel and Pixel 2 phones.[10] A preview of Lens has also been implemented into the Google Photos app for Pixel phones.[11] On March 5, 2018 Google officially released Google Lens to Google Photos on non-Pixel phones.[12] Support for Lens in the iOS version of Google Photos was made on March 15, 2018.[13] Beginning in May 2018, Google Lens was made available within Google Assistant on OnePlus devices,[14] as well as being integrated into camera apps of various Android phones.[15] A standalone Google Lens app was made available on Google Play in June 2018. Device support is limited, although it is not clear which devices are not supported or why. It requires Android Marshmallow (6.0) or newer.[16] On December 10, 2018 Google rolled out the Lens visual search feature[17] to the Google app for iOS.[18]</p>

    <p>MobileNet is a CNN architecture model for Image Classification and Mobile Vision.There are other models as well but what makes MobileNet special that it very less computation power to run or apply transfer learning to.This makes it a perfect fit for Mobile devices,embedded systems and computers without GPU or low computational efficiency with compromising significantly with the accuracy of the results.It is also best suited for web browsers as browsers have limitation over computation,graphic processing and storage.</p>
